How have you been?\n\nHi Peter,\n\nIt has been a while since we talked last time, hope everything is going well with you.\n\nHow are things? Are there any exciting plans coming up?\n\nI'm doing pretty fine as usual, and I can still remember that time when we were hanging out together...\n\nLooking forward to your reply!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to edit it or add more personalized contents before sending. Would you like me to proceed with this draft? If so, please give permission for me (Task Planning Agent) to send the email on your behalf.\n\nIf you need adjustments or wish to write an entirely different message, let me know what changes should be made!"
